# Computational Art 
Using purely python and mathetical computations to create randomly generated artistic images.
An example of the output is included. Since output are generated randomly, every art is unique in itself.

Example: myart.png

![example](/examples/myart.png)

# To run this project
Make sure [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed on your device. 
No packages needs to be installed.

To create your own art, simply run in terminal:

```bash
python recursive_art.py
```

And an png image named myart.png will be outputted to your current directory.
